## Test 
* Hackpad

run SentimentHackpad.ipynb 

runs analysis on a text file (must be local to user) which presumably contains the contents of the hackpad (but really could be any text)

* Commits

run Parse GitHub links from Hackpad.ipynb
then
run Commit Happiness Part II.ipynb

scrapes github links from hackpad, then finds all commits in their master branches, and analyses them
